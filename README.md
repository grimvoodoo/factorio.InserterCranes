# Factorio: Inserter Cranes
When creating train stations in factorio, I disliked the amount of inserters/loaders required for every single cargo wagon.

*This mod adds larger inserters called cranes with larger hand stack sizes and up-scaled throughput based on the building size.*

## Notes
- Works best in combination with [Long Warehouses](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/nco-LongWarehouses)
- Feel free to review and improve my code.
- If you want me to support more inserters please provide a pull request
- I would appreciate if someone would make a nice mod icon
- Please also check [my other mods](https://mods.factorio.com/user/karoschel)
